Separating persistence and domain models is generally considered a good practice in software architecture, particularly in complex systems. This approach aligns with the principles of clean architecture, domain-driven design (DDD), and the single responsibility principle (SRP). Here are some reasons and benefits for keeping these models separate:

Benefits of Separating Persistence and Domain Models

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each model has a single responsibility. Persistence models (or entities) handle database interactions, while domain models encapsulate business logic and rules.

Clear Boundaries: It establishes a clear boundary between the database schema and business logic, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.

Decoupling: It decouples the business logic from the database schema, allowing changes in the database schema without affecting the business logic and vice versa.

Testability: Domain models are easier to unit test without involving the database, making tests faster and more reliable.

Flexibility: It provides flexibility to change the persistence technology or strategy (e.g., switching from a relational database to a NoSQL database) without impacting the domain logic.

Separation of Concerns: Separates concerns of data storage from business logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
